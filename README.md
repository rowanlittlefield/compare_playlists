# Compare Playlists

This app acts as an api webservice with a single route `/compare-playlists`. The webservice will respond to a url of the form `https://<your-domain>.com/compare-playlists?spotify=<spotify_playlist_id>&appleMusic=<apple_music_playlist_id>` and will subsequently issue requests to retrieve the playlists found in the Spotify API with an id of `<spotify_playlist_id>` and in the AppleMusic API with an id of `<apple_music_playlist_id>`. The api action will then issue a response in json format with a 'count' key pointing to the number of shared tracks found between the Spotify and AppleMusic playlists. 

The controller for the single route web app can be found in `app/controllers/api/playlists_controller.rb`. The http client classes can be found in the `app/services` directory. The unit tests for the single controller action can be found in `spec/controllers/api/playlists_controller.rb`. After cloning/downloading this directory, run `bundle install` in the root directory of the project in the terminal in order to download and install all of the gems/dependencies for the app. The specs for the project can then be run by running `bundle exec rspec` in the root directory.
